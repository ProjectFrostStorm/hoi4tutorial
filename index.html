            Before we begin, HOI4 is a &lt;5GB, CPU heavy game and as such, can run on a wide variety of machines, including laptops (but do beware of heat up during gameplay).
            However, do be aware that a slowdown is still to be expected towards the lategame due to the sheer number of units handled by both players and the AI.

        <p>
            So, you've downloaded <b>Hearts of Iron IV</b> and are finally ready to begin your story of conquest! <br>
            Once you've launched hoi4 from <b>Steam</b>, you should be greeted by the <b>Paradox Interactive Launcher</b>. Much like the one for <b>Stellaris</b>, here you can enable and 
            disable mods and DLCs for the game, as well as modify certain launch settings. <br>
            Feel free to ignore everything here and just hit <strong>play</strong>!
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/1 launcher.png" alt="The Paradox Interactive Launcher for Hearts of Iron 4's main screen.">
            <figcaption>The HOI4 launcher. Change your DLCs and mod settings here!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <!-- <h3>0.1 - Menus and Options</h3> -->

        <p>
            Depending on whether you installed hoi4 on a hard drive or SSD, hoi4 can take up to a few minutes to load. It is normal for it to take surprising long to load on a first
            boot, much like <b>Stellaris</b>. <br>
            Once you're in, you'll be greeted by the hoi4 main menu! Head on over to the <strong>Options</strong> tab before you start playing.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/2 main menu.png" alt="The Hearts of Iron 4 main menu screen. The background is of D-Day, the default without DLCs.">
            <figcaption>The main menu for HOI4! You should see this same background art of D-Day if you did not buy any DLCs.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Here, feel free to set your settings to those that you prefer, such as toning down graphical settings. However, be aware of two things. <br>
            One, <strong>audio is important</strong> in hoi4, as many important notification will play a sound effect when they occur. Learning to recognize these alerts will 
            greatly improve your ability in playing! <br>
            And two, <strong>ensure the following graphical options are enabled</strong>, as it is easier to play with these visual indicators.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/3 graphical options.png" alt="The Hearts of Iron 4 options screen. The options for 3D buildings, 3D units, and rivers are highlighted.">
            <figcaption>Make sure to enable these options as well as sound!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Next, head on over to the <strong>Multiplayer</strong> tab. Here is where you can host or join multiplayer games of hoi4. <br>
            Once you're here, make sure to <strong>change your nickname</strong> on the top left where it says <em>player</em>! All players are given this nickname by default, so it'll be confusing if 
            we have a bunch of "Players" running around in our games. <br>
            Here, it is most reliable to either join games via Steam or have the host send you the server ID and use the <strong>Connect to Server ID</strong> button.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/4 multiplayer menu.png" alt="The Hearts of Iron 4 multiplayer screen. The nickname and Connect to Server ID buttons are highlighted.">
            <figcaption>Remember that a multiplayer will only use the DLCs of the host, which is then shared to all joining players.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Here's what the multiplayer lobby looks like. Besides the inclusion of the multiplayer lobby, it is almost identical to what it looks like in singleplayer. 
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/5 multiplayer lobby.png" alt="The Hearts of Iron 4 multiplayer lobby screen.">
            <figcaption>Don't worry about the map, we'll get to it soon!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Head back to the main menu and go to the <strong>Singleplayer</strong> tab. Let's actually jump into the game now! <br>
            Make sure to select the <strong>1936 Gathering Storm</strong> scenario.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/6 scenario selection.png" alt="The Hearts of Iron 4 multiplayer scenario selection screen.">
            <figcaption>The 1939 one will jump you straight into action, but you won't get to set things up yourself!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            You'll now find yourself on the <strong>Interesting Countries</strong> screen. Here, you can select one of the major countries (known as <strong>majors</strong>) on the 
            top or one of the minor countries (known as <strong>minors</strong>) that <em>have additional content</em> on the bottom. Feel free to look through each country to see 
            what interests you! <br>
            Now, hit the <strong>Other countries</strong> option to see the potential that hoi4 can offer.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/7 interesting countries all dlc.png" alt="The Hearts of Iron 4 Interesting Countries menu. All DLC nations up to Battle for the Bosphorus are present.">
            <figcaption>If you only have the base game, you'll only see Poland as an available minor (with the free United and Ready DLC). With additional DLCs, as you can see, you can get many more!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            And here's something that truly makes hoi4 special. Any nation present on the map, you can play as by using <strong>LMB (left clicking)</strong>! <br>
            To navigate the map, you can either use <strong>the arrow keys</strong> or <strong>click and drag using MMB (the mouse wheel)</strong>. <br>
            <strong>Scroll up and down</strong> to zoom in and out of the map. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you feel accustomed to the controls of map navigation (you'll need to do this alot in the game!) feel free to pick a nation and get started. I recommend picking a 
            <strong>major</strong> to begin with, specifically the <em>German Reich</em> or <em>Italy</em> (be careful that Italy starts in a war with Ethiopia!). <br>
            Make sure to <strong>enable historical AI focuses</strong> so you can rely on your knowledge of history!
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/8 country map selection.png" alt="The Hearts of Iron 4 country selection map. The United States is selected and both the enabled historical AI focuses and start button are highlighted.">
            <figcaption>This tutorial will use the United States, since I feel uncomfortable having so many pictures of fascist leaders in a public facing site...</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            And with that, you're starting your first game of Hearts of Iron IV! This marks the end of chapter 0 of this tutorial. <br>
            Now, we'll really start getting into the game with the next chapter!
        </p>

        <h2 id="Chapter_1_-_Beginner_Section">Chapter 1 - Beginner Section</h2>

        <h3 id="1.0_-_General_Tips">1.0 - General Tips</h3>

        <p>
            Before we start this section, I'd like to begin with some small tips that you should keep in mind throughout this entire guide.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Many things have tooltips! When in doubt, mouse over something. Chances are, it'll pop up a tooltip explaining more details!
            </li>
            <li>
                Hoi4 takes advantages of colours alot. If something is green, that's generally a good thing. If something is red, that's generally bad. Even if you don't know what 
                something does, you can use this rule of thumb to figure out if it's beneficial or not!
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            And with that, let's jump into things! As we've left off in the previous chapter, you should now be in a game of hoi4. <strong>Don't be overwhelmed by the number of buttons!</strong>
            We'll slowly, but surely, get through all of them. <br>
            For now, turn your attention to the <strong>alerts</strong> near the top of the screen.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/9 starting usa.png" alt="The starting screen for the United States. The alert icons at the top of the screen are highlighted.">
            <figcaption>Try to tune out the visual noise and focus on what's highlighted!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            These alerts generally indicate important issues plaguing your country that you should address. Mousing over them will give additional details on what the issue at hand is. <br>
            <strong>Left click</strong> them to be sent to the relevant menu to address the issue and <strong>right click</strong> to dismiss them (<em>but don't do any of that now!</em>).
        </p>

        <p>
            These issue cover a wide range of gameplay, so we'll tackle them slowly and in a particular order. Hopefully this guide will explain everything clearly!
        </p>

        <h3 id="1.1_-_Basic_Country_Management">1.1 - Basic Country Management</h3>

        <h4 id="1.1.1_-_National_Focus">1.1.1 - National Focus</h4>

        <p>
            First, turn your attention to this icon. 
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/10 national focus not set alert.png" alt="The National Focus not set alert icon and tooltip.">
        </figure>

        <p>
            This indicates that a <strong>National Focus</strong> has not been set. You can access the <strong>National Focus Tree</strong> via the <strong>Political Tab</strong> 
            which you can open by <strong>clicking your flag</strong> or by <strong>pressing Q</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="images/11 going to national focus tree.png" alt="The National Focus tree button for the United States. The button and the flag are highlighted.">
            <figcaption>The flag is a button!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Here, you'll be brought to your country's national focus tree. These trees are different between countries to reflect different situations different countries found 
            themselves in the 1930s. Countries that do not have content (or is locked behind DLC) will use the <strong>Generic Focus Tree</strong> instead. <br>
            To naviagate the tree, <strong>click and drag (LMB)</strong> to move around the tree and <strong>scroll up and down</strong> to zoom in and out.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/12 usa focus tree.png" alt="The political section of the United States focus tree.">
            <figcaption>Here's part of the US focus tree. Some DLCs also add additional content for existing focus trees, so if you're playing alongside me as the US, you'll notice that I have some extra alternative history branches! (and a spicy focus on the bottom right)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            To view a focus, <strong>left click it</strong> to see its <strong>requirements</strong>, <strong>effects</strong>, and <strong>time to complete</strong> as well as the 
            option to <strong>start completing it</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/12.5 focus details.png" alt="The Continue the New Deal focus with the start button highlighted.">
            <figcaption>Continue FDR's New Deal!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Focuses that are <strong>gold</strong> are <strong>completed</strong>. Ones that are <strong>grey</strong> are <strong>available</strong>. 
            And ones that are <strong>black</strong> are <strong>still locked</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/13 focus options.png" alt="Three focuses, one completed, one available, and one locked.">
            <figcaption>Here, Continue the New Deal has been completed, Neutrality Act is available but not yet done, and The Giant Wakes is still locked.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Like a proper tree, the focus tree has branches and <strong>exclusive paths</strong>. Sometimes the lines can be confusing, so just read the focus requirements!
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/14 splits and forks in focus tree.png" alt="A split branch in the focus tree.">
            <figcaption>Here, Limited Intervention and Neutrality Act are mutually exclusive and thus so is War Propaganda and Arsenal of Democracy. Lend Lease Act is available with either focus though.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Many focuses typically take <strong>70 days</strong> to complete and only <strong>one focus can be completed at any one time</strong>. You'll generally be able to get
            through all focuses within a game, but keep in mind that some focuses might no longer be worth it towards the end! <br>
            If you're playing along as the German Reich or Italy, I recommend starting with <em>Rhineland</em> or <em>Ethiopian War Logistics</em> as your first focus.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that HOI4 runs at <strong>one hour per tick</strong> in contrast to <b>Stellaris</b> which runs at <strong>one day per tick</strong>. To compensate, while 
            <b>Stellaris</b> runs from 2200 to 2500, HOI4 runs from <strong>1936 to 1948</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/15 clock.png" alt="The top right corner of the UI. The ingame clock is highlighted.">
            <figcaption>All games start at 12pm of Janurary 1, 1936 (except if you do the other scenario).</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4 id="1.1.2_-_Research">1.1.2 - Research</h4>

        <p>
            Now we can move on to the second tree system in HOI4, the <strong>research tree</strong>. <br>
            Turn your attention to this icon.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/16 research slot alert.png" alt="The Research Slot not in use alert icon and tooltip.">
        </figure>

        <p>
            This indicates that you have research slots not currently in use. You can access the <strong>Research Tab</strong> by clicking the little 
            <strong>magnifying glass and beaker icon</strong> or by <strong>pressing W</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/17 research tab.png" alt="The Research Tab for the USA. There are 4 unused slots.">
            <figcaption>Different countries start with different numbers of research slots. The US, being very advanced, starts with 4. Countries can have between 1 and 6 slots overall.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Clicking any of these slots will bring you to the research tree. Unlike national focus trees, research trees are <strong>the same for every country</strong>, though 
            different countries may <strong>start with</strong> different technologies. <br>
            Technologies in <strong>green</strong> are already <strong>researched</strong>. Those in <strong>yellow</strong> are <strong>available</strong> and those in 
            <strong>grey</strong> are <strong>still locked</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/18 initial research tree.png" alt="The ground unit research tab for the USA.">
            <figcaption>Note how the US starts with Infantry Equipment I (2nd tier of guns) and Motorized (trucks) already researched.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            To naviagate the tree, <strong>click and drag (LMB)</strong> to move around. Use <strong>left click</strong> to select technologies and change tabs.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/19 research details.png" alt="The Support Weapons I technology.">
            <figcaption>The research tree functions very similarily to the focus tree.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Unlike national focus trees, research trees are split into <strong>different tabs</strong> which can be access along the top. These tabs are <strong>colour coded</strong> 
            based on what field they fall in, with <strong>green</strong> meaning <strong>land units</strong>, <strong>blue</strong> meaning <strong>navy</strong>, <strong>red</strong>
            meaning <strong>airforce</strong>, and <strong>orange</strong> meaning <strong>civilian</strong>. <br>
            To simplify things, feel free to ignore most research tabs and focus only on the following.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/20 recommended research tabs.png" alt="The research tree with the infantry, armor, artillery, engineering, and industry tabs highlighted.">
            <figcaption>Feel free to also research into the Support Companies and Land Doctrine tabs if you are comfortable! (i.e. the remaining green tabs)</figcaption>

            You may have already noticed the years on the screen that roughly line up with certain technologies. This indicates what <strong>year a technology is from</strong> and 
            researching technologies that are in the future will encur a <strong>time ahead penalty</strong>. This penalty lessens the closer you get to the actual time of the technology. <br>
            Only <strong>Doctrine technologies</strong> (in their respective doctrine tabs) are timeless.
        </p>

            Multiple research slots work <strong>independent</strong> of each other, so make sure all your research slots are always researching something! <br>
            I recommending starting with <em>Basic Machine Tools</em> or <em>Concentrated Industry I</em>, <em>Construction I</em>, <em>Electronic Mechanical Engineering</em> or 
            <em>Mechanical Computing</em>, and either <em>Support Weapons I</em> or the next Land Doctrine technology as your first technologies.

            <figcaption>These technologies can be found in the Industry, Engineering, Infantry, and Land Doctrine tabs.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Lastly, note that <strong>not all technologies give existing things bonuses</strong>. Some, instead, introduce <strong>brand new equipment</strong> that need to be 
            produced before you get its benefit. What do I mean about <strong>producing equipment</strong>? Well keep that in the back of your mind because it'll come up in a little bit!

            And that's the end of the trees! This may be a good time to take a break and let what you've learnt sink in. Or to maybe reread everything up till now to really cement
            that understanding. Either way, good work! That's two major game concepts out of the way for now!

        <h4 id="1.1.3_-_Construction">1.1.3 - Construction</h4>

        <p>
            Now let's move on to buildings and construction. Turn your attention to this icon.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/25 civs not in use alert.png" alt="The civilian factory not in use alert icon and tooltip.">
        </figure>

        <p>
            This indicates that you have <strong>Civilian Factories</strong> (often shortened to <strong>civs</strong>) that are standing idle. <br>
            Civs represent the civilian industrial capabilities of your country and thus tend to make up <strong>the backbone of your economy</strong>. Buildings and structures in 
            hoi4 are <strong>built by civs</strong>. <br>
            To put them to work, 
            head over to the <strong>Construction Tab</strong> by clicking the little <strong>digger</strong> or by <strong>pressing T</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/26 construction tab.png" alt="The Construction Tab for the USA.">
            <figcaption>The US has a mighty economy, hence why they have over 100 starting civs!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            The construction tab is where you can <strong>queue up buildings to be built</strong>, but before we talk about how to do so, we need to talk about 
            <strong>states</strong> and <strong>provinces</strong>.
        </p>

        <!-- Anchor Here? -->

        <p>
            When you click a piece of territory on land, <strong>two</strong> things will be highlighted: the smaller <strong>province</strong> in bright <strong>yellow</strong> and the 
            larger <strong>state</strong> in <strong>white</strong>. <br>
            Also open is some information about the state and province. Note that only <strong>states</strong> have names (this state is <em>New York</em>).
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/24 state and province example.png" alt="New York City, New York province selected.">
            <figcaption>Keep an eye on that infobox in the bottom left, it'll come up soon!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Provinces are the <strong>smallest subdivision</strong> of the hoi4 map and is the <strong>grid system for ground units</strong>, meaning ground units move and attack 
            along province lines (<strong>a province can only have units from one allied side within it</strong> during wartime!). <br>
            States are collections of provinces and is the smallest subdivision of territory <strong>in terms of control</strong> (i.e. in peace time, a state can only be controlled by 
            <strong>exactly one</strong> country). 
            <!-- Unnessary -->
            <strong>Claims</strong> and <strong>Cores</strong> are thus also enacted at the state level.
        </p>

        <p>
            Why this is important, is because buildings in hoi4 come in three flavours: <strong>state structures</strong> (top), <strong>shared structures</strong> (middle), and 
            <strong>province structures</strong> (bottom). <br>
            The most important buildings and structures are state and shared structures, both types of which are built <strong>at the state level</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/27 building types.png" alt="The different buildings and structures of Hearts of Iron 4.">
            <figcaption>Notice that some buildings are greyed out, as they have yet to be unlocked in the research tab.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            We'll be ignoring most of the state structures for now, but let's take a quick peek at how building them works. Select the <strong>infastructure railway icon</strong> in the 
            construction tab.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/28 build infa.png" alt="The construction tab with the infastructure button highlighted.">
            <figcaption>Infastructure is the only important state structure for now.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Whoa! That's a lot of stuff! Don't worry about most of it, what is important is that each state has a <strong>number out of ten</strong> at the top. This number indicates the 
            current <strong>level of infastructure</strong> in that state, which can go up to a <strong>maximum of ten</strong>. <br>
            All <strong>state structures</strong> work the same way, where the structure can be upgraded to its maximum, <strong>no matter the state</strong> (as long as you own it). <br>
            Also note that all these states are in <strong>green</strong>. States that you can still build in will be green, while states that are full will be <strong>blue</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/29 where to build infa.png" alt="The build map for infastructure for the USA.">
            <figcaption>Also note that the darker the green, the more full the state is for the building!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Let's avoid building any infastructure for now. You can exit this mode by <strong>exiting the construction tab</strong> or you can <strong>select a different building</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's start actually building! We should begin with the two most important buildings of hoi4, <strong>civilian factories</strong> and <strong>military factories</strong>. 
            A country needs its industry for both its economy and military, so let's queue up some factories! <br>
            <strong>Select the orange civilian factory icon</strong> in the construction tab.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/30 build civs.png" alt="The construction tab with the civilian factory button highlighted.">
            <figcaption>Colour is very important in hoi4!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Another build map! This time it should be less intimidating. And look, some states are now in blue, indicating that they are full for civilian factories! <br>
            You've probably now noticed that this time, the build cap is different for each state. This is because, unlike infastructure, civilian factories are <strong>shared buildings</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/31 where to build civs.png" alt="The build map for factories for the USA.">
            <figcaption>Notice the little infastructure icon with a green percentage? The more infastrcture you have in a state, the faster it is to build in it!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Each state (depending on how populated and industrious it is) has a different number of <strong>shared building slots</strong>. These slots are 
            <strong>shared among all shared buildings</strong>. <br>
            For example, <em>New York</em> has 12 starting building slots, so only 12 shared buildings can be built in that state.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/32 building slots.png" alt="The infobox for the state of New York. The build slots and shared buildings are highlighted.">
            <figcaption>In this example, the shared buildings New York has are 2 military factories, 7 civilian factories, and 3 dockyards.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            The number of building slots a state has can be increased via some <strong>national focuses</strong> (and typically with some free buildings) and 
            through the <em>concentrated industry</em> or <em>dispersed industry</em> technology, up to a maximum of 25 building slots.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, let's actually start building! <br>
            To build in a state, <strong>left click</strong> to add it to the queue, <strong>right click</strong> to remove it from the queue. <br>
            <strong>Shift left click</strong> fills the state with the building you selected, <strong>shift right click</strong> empties the state of the building queues. <br>
            <strong>Control left click</strong> places the order to the top of the queue. <br>
            States with <strong>yellow stripes</strong> have your currently selected building in the queue, states with <strong>blue stripes</strong> have your currently selected 
            building in the queue <strong>and have no more free building slots</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/33 actually building.png" alt="Factories are being built in the northern USA. 6 factories are queued across 3 states.">
            <figcaption>Don't ask me why Paradox decided 4 of the 5 Great Lakes count as American.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Now with your factory orders in the queue, your civilian factories will work to complete those orders. <strong>Up to 15 civs can work on the same order</strong> at the 
            same time. The <strong>little progress bar</strong> can be <strong>moused over</strong> to see <strong>more details</strong>, such as when it'll finish building. <br>
            Extra civs (beyond the 15 working on the initial order) will work on subsequent orders, but only on <strong>subsequent orders of different buildings or in different states</strong>
            (e.g. the extra factories in the image are working on <em>Ohio</em>'s next factory, not <em>Florida</em>'s second dockyard). <br>
            You can change the order of the queue either by <strong>click and dragging</strong> them or by <strong>using the arrows</strong>. <strong>Shift left clicking</strong> 
            the arrows will send them to the beginning or end of the queue. Progress on a build order <strong>will be saved</strong> if you change the queue order. <br>
            You can use the little <strong>plus and minus</strong> buttons to add or remove building queues (shift clicking the plus button also fills the state). The <strong>X button</strong> will cancel all of that one type of queue (with a confirmation).
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/34 example build queue.png" alt="Many builds queued to be built. One such order is highlighted.">
            <figcaption>This is just an example build queue, don't follow this exact sequence! (cuz it pretty bad)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Whew, that was a lot! Now's a good time to take a break or try a bit of building yourself. Make sure that you feel comfortable with how construction works if you're 
            currently trying it out in a game. <br>
            I suggest your first constructions as a major to be <strong>civs</strong> in states with the <strong>highest infastructure bonus</strong> (that little green percentage
            when you're on the factory build map).
        </p>

        <p>
            Before we move on, if you're keen-eyed, you may have notice a discrepancy in the build numbers. For example, in the above image, it says that I have 165/165 civs, but yet 
            only 32 are actually working on building stuff. This is because all remaining 133 are being used for <strong>consumer goods</strong>. <br>
            Hoi4 is a game about war and not about peacetime (if you're interested in something with more peacetime focus, try <b>Victoria II</b> or <b>Victoria 3</b> when it comes out),
            so we don't care about what the needs of civilians are. As such, consumer goods give <strong>no benefits</strong> at all and only take up civilian factories that could've been used for building. <br>
            We'll be touching on <strong>internal politics</strong> later on, but for now keep in the back of your mind that <strong>things that decrease consumer goods factories are good</strong>
            and <strong>things that increase it are bad</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4 id="1.1.4_-_Production">1.1.4 - Production</h4>

        <p>
            An army without guns is just a big crowd and it is up to you to plan your country's war effort! That's right, it's time to talk about <strong>equipment production</strong>! <br>
            Turn your attention now to this icon.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/35 mils not in use alert.png" alt="The military factories not in use alert icon.">
        </figure>

        <p>
            This indicates you have <strong>Military Factories</strong> (often shortened to <strong>mils</strong>) that are idle. <br>
            Unlike civilian factories, military factories are tooled to <strong>produce military hardware</strong>. <br>
            To add them to production lines, head over to the <strong>Production Tab</strong> by clicking the little <strong>wrench and gear</strong> or by <strong>pressing Y</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/36 production tab.png" alt="The production tab for the USA.">
            <figcaption>The US doesn't start with as big of a military base, but that'll change quickly!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            In hoi4, equipment are produced in <strong>assembly lines</strong>, where many factories can work together on producing one kind of equipment. <br>
            Let's focus on just one assembly line. The assembly line indicates <strong>what equipment it is producing</strong>, <strong>its rate of production</strong>, 
            and <strong>how many mils are assigned</strong> to the production line.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/37 production line basic info.png" alt="A production line for the USA's M1 Garand. The equipment type, production rate, and factories assigned are highlighted.">
            <figcaption>The green bar underneath the production rate shows the equipment's production progress, which is updated per day. Since we're producing more than one a day, the bar is solid.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            More factories can be assigned using the little <strong>plus and minus buttons</strong> (holding down <strong>control</strong> changes it to increments of five, 
            <strong>shift</strong> changes it to increements of ten) or by <strong>clicking a square in the grid of factories</strong> (clicking the <strong>x5 and x10</strong>
            changes the increments).
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/38 assigning mils.png" alt="Assigning factories to a production line of support equipment. More factories then there are present are assigned to infantry equipment.">
            <figcaption>Left clicking here will assign 5 additional factories to support equipment (for a total of 6).</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Notice that in the top production line, 6 of the 13 factories are <strong>greyed out</strong>. This is because we've <strong>assigned more factories than there currently exists</strong>. 
            When new mils are made available, they will <strong>automatically be assigned to these greyed out position</strong>, in priority from <strong>top to bottom</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            A new production line can be created using the buttons at the top of the tab. They are sorted by <strong>equipment type</strong>, being split between infantry, armor, 
            and air. Simply select what equipment you wish to produce and a new production line will be created <strong>at the bottom</strong>. <br>
            Productions lines can be moved around by <strong>clicking and dragging</strong> them and can be deleted by <strong>clicking the little trash icon</strong> (with a confirmation).
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/39 creating and deleting production lines.png" alt="Creating a new infantry production line. The create production line buttons, equipment, and a delete production line button are highlighted.">
            <figcaption>Try to have unified production lines, so only one production line of one kind of equipment. It'll simplify things a lot!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            You can also change what equipment an existing production line is producing, which is typically <strong>only used for changing production to an upgraded equipment</strong>.
            To do so, simply <strong>click the equipment picture</strong> and find the replacing equipment (be careful to select the right equipment for reasons coming up!). <br>
            Outdated equipment being produced will have a <strong>brown background</strong> and you'll also get an alert icon.
        </p>

            <figcaption>Upgraded versions of equipment will have a faint glowing effect and appear towards the top of the list when you first check your production's equipment.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <!-- This below section might be too overcomplicated for chapter 1 -->

        <p>
            The last two things we'll be covering about production lines are <strong>production efficiency</strong> and <strong>resources</strong>. <br>
            Starting with production efficiency, it is why you should be careful about switching equipment. Essentially, the longer a production line is <strong>left untouched</strong>, the 
            <strong>better it becomes at producing equipment</strong>. This bonus is reduced when adding new factories and when switching production. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, all equipment requires <strong>resources</strong> to produce. A unit of resource in hoi4 is <strong>not</strong> a single unit of resource, but rather 
            <strong>a constant income of a unit of resource</strong>. Resources will be covered later on, but for now, know that a production line that is <strong>missing resources</strong>
            will <strong>produce equipment and earn efficiency at a slower rate</strong> (or even 0 depending on the equipment and missing resources!).
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/41 prod eff and lack of resources.png" alt="A production line that has low efficiency and is missing some resources.">
            <figcaption>An equipment production bar in yellow means it is missing some resources. Red means it is missing a catastrophic amount of resources.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <!-- This above section ... -->

        <p>
            You'll notice that we've only been dealing with the <strong>green</strong> material in the production tab and not the <strong>blue</strong> material. Similar to ground 
            and air equipment, <strong>ships</strong> are produced with <strong>dockyards</strong>, but have some key differences. Due to this, don't worry about it for now! <br>
            If you do have extra dockyards sitting around, feel free to put them on to <em>convoys</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            And with that, you've made it past the production mechanics! This is a good time to stop and take in everything, as production is one of the most densely packed 
            gameplay feature. Feel free to take some time and familiarize yourself with production lines when you get a chance. <br>
            If you're following along in game, I suggest starting your production line in a similar fashion to mine below.
        </p>

        <h4 id="1.1.5_-_Government">1.1.5 - Government</h4>

        <p>
            That was a lot of difficult gameplay mechanics! We'll finish up this section with a small intro to managing your government. <br>
            Navigate back to the <strong>politics tab</strong> by <strong>clicking your flag</strong> or <strong>pressing Q</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the top of the screen, there are three stats/resources for your nation. From left to right, they are <strong>political power</strong>, <strong>stability</strong>, and 
            <strong>war support</strong>. <br>
            Below the national focus button, you have your country's <strong>national spirits</strong>. <br>
            The final thing we'll discuss in this section is your <strong>governing laws and advisors</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/43 government tab.png" alt="The politics tab for the USA. Political power, stability, war support, national spirits, and the laws and advisors are highlighted.">
            <figcaption>We'll discuss that political pie chart in chapter 2!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            First, the three at the top. <strong>Political power</strong> is passively earned <strong>per day</strong> at a <strong>base rate of 2 per day</strong>, but 
            <strong>1 is also consumed each day a national focus is progressing</strong>. It is used to <strong>modify your government</strong> and to <strong>enact decisions</strong>. 
            Political power can go into the negatives and is capped at <strong>2000</strong>. <br>
            Next, <strong>stability</strong> and <strong>war support</strong> are measures of your population's opinion of your country. They range between <strong>0% to 100%</strong>,
            but the value <strong>can go over and under this cap</strong> (negative values will be displayed, but values over 100 will not). 
            The base line value for both is <strong>50%</strong>, where you recieve <strong>no positive nor negative effects</strong>. You can <strong>mouse over</strong> both values 
            to see what benefits or penalties are being applied.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>National spirits</strong> are representation of forces acting within your country. They can have <strong>positive, negative, or a mixed of both effects</strong>.
            They are typically gained or removed through <strong>national focuses or events</strong>.

            <strong>Laws, advisors, designers, and military staff</strong> of your government can be changed at any time, given you <strong>have the political power</strong> and 
            <strong>meet the prerequisites for whatever you are changing</strong>. They give various useful buffs to your country.
        </p>

        <p>
            And that's it! Short one this time, as learning about laws and government is best done through experience. It doesn't matter too much if you hire incorrect advisors,
            so feel free to try things out! <br>
            With that, we've completed the basic country management section! In our next section, we'll be learning about <strong>basic army management</strong>. Feel free to take a
            break and come back later!

        <h3 id="1.2_-_Basic_Army_Management">1.2 - Basic Army Management</h3>

        <p>
            Hoi4 is a game about warfare, so it's now time to talk about the most core gameplay aspect of the game, <strong>unit and army management</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4 id="1.2.1_-_Divisions">1.2.1 - Divisions</h4>

        <p>
            Unlike other grand strategy games such as <b>Civilization</b>, but much like other <b>Paradox Interactive</b> games such as <b>Stellaris</b>, hoi4 is a 
            <strong>real time strategy with pausing</strong>. As such, it can be beneficial to think of units in hoi4 like units in <strong>other real time strategy games</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>

        </figure>

        <p>
            In hoi4, individual controllable units on the map are known as <strong>divisions</strong> and represent large organizations of personnel and equipment, often to the 
            thosuands or tens of thousands.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/45 divisions.png" alt="Divisions in Hearts of Iron 4.">
            <figcaption>The Canadian Armed Forces currently fields 4 divisions (as of 2021). In hoi4, expect to get way more than that!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            As mentioned when we were talking about construction, divisions reside, move, and attack along <strong>provinces</strong>. More than one friendly division can be in 
            the same province at the same time. <br>
            Divisions can be selected by <strong>left clicking</strong> or <strong>box selecting</strong>. A division's selection can be <strong>toggled</strong> by using 
            <strong>shift left click</strong>. A stack of divisions will all be selected when clicked (a stack will be separated if you zoom in while they are selected). <br>
            After being selected, some <strong>details about the division</strong> will appear on the <strong>top left</strong>. Divisions can also be selected or deselected via it.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/46 selecting divisions.png" alt="Various divisions being selected in Hearts of Iron 4.">
            <figcaption>This menu in the top left will always show your currently selected divisions.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <!-- Remove sentence on exp? -->

        <p>
            Here you'll find information on your selected divisions. We'll ignore the other symbols and bars for now and instead focus on the division's <strong>name</strong> and 
            <strong>icon</strong>. <br>
            The <strong>name</strong> and <strong>icon</strong> of a division helps you identify a specific division and its <strong>division template</strong>, which you can think 
            of as <strong>different unit types</strong> for now.
        </p>

            <figcaption>The colourful stuff will be important later!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Some of those same stats can be seen at a glance via a division's <strong>map icon</strong> as well as a division's allegiance. You may also notice the giant soldiers, 
            which makes it easier to tell which province a division is in and what action that division is currently performing. That's why <strong>3D units</strong> should be 
            enabled!
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h4 id="1.2.2_-_Microing">1.2.2 - Microing</h4>

        <p>
            A division isn't of much use if it's just sitting there, so let's go over <strong>issuing unit orders</strong>! In hoi4, this is known as <strong>micromanagement</strong>
            (or <strong>microing</strong>), as there are controls to issue orders to large groups of divisions. Even so, microing remains very important in army management!
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>With a division selected</strong>, <strong>right click a friendly province</strong> to issue a <strong>move order</strong>. <strong>Shift right click</strong>
            will queue a move order <strong>after the unit's existing move orders</strong>. When a unit is moving, a division's <strong>action icon will change</strong> and 
            <strong>mousing over the destination</strong> will display the fastest unit's <strong>time to arrival</strong>. <br>
            <strong>Any order</strong> (including moving and attacking) can be cancelled by pressing the <strong>small red halt button</strong> or by <strong>pressing H</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/49 moving divisions.png" alt="A division is moving around the map. The division's move icon and time to arrive are highlighted as well as the halt button.">
            <figcaption>Lots of arrows in this game!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            If a unit is ordered to move <strong>into an enemy province</strong>, the order becomes an <strong>attack order</strong> with the arrow turning from <strong>yellow</strong>
            to <strong>red</strong>. If an <strong>enemy division is present</strong> in that province, <strong>a battle will commence</strong>. <br>
            Move orders and attack orders are <strong>functionally identical</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/50 attacking divisions.png" alt="Three American divisions are attacking into Canada. The division's attack icons are highlighted.">
            <figcaption>Oh boy...</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Having to micro dozens of divisions at once would quickly become very tedious, so hoi4 gives you tools to manage many divisions at once.
        </p>

        <h4 id="1.2.3_-_Armies">1.2.3 - Armies</h4>

        <p>
            Like in real life, divisions in hoi4 can be managed into <strong>armies</strong>. Armies can be created by clicking the <strong>empty portrait icon with divisions</strong>
            selected (doing so will automatically add the selected divisions into that army).
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/51 creating army.png" alt="26 American divisions are selected. The create army button is highlighted.">
            <figcaption>It's the button on the right, not the one on the left!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            You can <strong>shift left click</strong> the <strong>unassigned divisions alert icon</strong> to easily select all unassigned divisions and assign them to an army.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/52 unassigned divisions alert.png" alt="The unassigned divisions alert icon.">
        </figure>

        <p>
            Armies in hoi4 have two main benefits, <strong>organizing divisions</strong> and <strong>issuing mass orders</strong>. <br>
            First, notice how it becomes easier to select relevant units, as all units in the army will appear in the unit sidebar <strong>even if they aren't selected</strong>,
            making it easier to select and deselect certain divisions. <br>
            <strong>Double clicking</strong> an army (at the bottom of the screen) will <strong>always select the army and all divisions within it</strong>. 
            Note that the army will also track how many divisions are assigned. <br>
            When an army is created, a <strong>colour</strong> is assigned to that army which allows divisions associated with that army to be easily identified. This colour can 
            be changed by <strong>clicking the colour tab</strong>. <br>
            Divisions can be <strong>unassigned from an army</strong> by clicking the little <strong>unassign</strong> button, and divisions can be <strong>transferred</strong> 
            between new and existing armies by selecting some divisions and either <strong>clicking the create army button</strong> or by 
            <strong>right clicking the destination army</strong>. If reassigning units will leave an army empty, that army will be deleted (with a confirmation). <br>
            A <strong>general</strong> can also be assigned to the army by <strong>clicking the portrait assignment</strong> in the unit sidebar. A general will boost the fighting
            capabilities of an army and bring useful skills. We'll cover more about generals in the next chapter!
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/53 armies.png" alt="An army of American divisions. The Army, colour tab, and unassign buttons are highlighted.">
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Next, while better organization is always great, the truly useful thing about armies is the ability to assign <strong>army-wide orders</strong>, known as 
            <strong>battle plans</strong>. <br>
            This allows you to give movement attack orders to dozens of divisions with only a few mouse clicks and frees you up to worry about the big picture during a war.
        </p>

        <p>
            Turn your attention to the <strong>battle plans bar</strong>, which appears whenever <strong>you have an army selected</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/54 battle plans bar.png" alt="An army of American divisions. The battle plans bar is highlighted.">
            <figcaption>More buttons! Don't worry, you'll quickly learn which buttons are used the most frequently.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            We'll only be focusing on some of the most commonly used battle plans as well as the battle plan editing buttons. The most essential battle plans are the 
            <strong>front line</strong>, <strong>offensive line</strong>, and <strong>fallback line</strong> plans.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/55 basic battle plans.png" alt="The battle plan bar. The front line, offensive line, fallback line, and battle plan editing buttons are selected.">
            <figcaption>The buttons on the right are exclusively to do with editing battle plans.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            First, the <strong>front line</strong> is, as the name suggests, an offensive line that your divisions will <strong>gather at</strong> for an attack. A front line is 
            only drawn on the <strong>border of another nation</strong> and can be drawn <strong>regardless of peace or wartime and regardless of allegiance</strong>. <br>
            To draw a front line, first select the <strong>front line</strong> button or <strong>press Z</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/56 select front line.png" alt="The battle plan bar. The front line button is highlighted.">
            <figcaption>Remember the front line button as this little soldier icon with a dotted line and plus sign!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Once selected, borders between you and other countries will glow <strong>yellow</strong>. Mousing over them will turn them <strong>green</strong> and 
            <strong>provinces your divisions will move to</strong> will be shown in <strong>green stripes</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/57 drawing front line.png" alt="A frontline about to be drawn between the border of the USA and Mexico.">
            <figcaption>Any borders work!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            <strong>Left clicking</strong> will draw a front line <strong>along the entire contiguous border</strong>. 
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/58 full front line.png" alt="A front line across the entire USA-Mexico border.">
        </figure>

        <p>
            To draw a <strong>partial front line</strong>, <strong>press and hold right click</strong> at where you want the front line <strong>to start</strong> and 
            <strong>drag it</strong> until you reached where you want the front line to <strong>end</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/59 partial front line.png" alt="A front line across some of the USA-Mexico border.">
        </figure>

        <p>
            With a battle plan drawn, you can see some details about it including <strong>which army it belongs to</strong> and <strong>how many divisions are assigned</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/60 front line info.png" alt="A front line saying that it belongs to the 1st army and has 26 divisions assigned to it.">
            <figcaption>Also, mousing over any battle plan will highlight the battle plan in a distinct green.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Whoa, what happened here? Many players new to the game might run into this issue, which occurs if they accidently drew a battle plan twice.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/61 doubled front line.png" alt="An accidential double front line.">
            <figcaption>Don't worry if it happens to you!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            These are actually <strong>two distinct front line orders</strong> and can occur because hoi4 allows players to <strong>draw multiple battle plans</strong> and have 
            <strong>empty battle plans</strong>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            First, battle plans are disjoint subsets of armies, meaning that while <strong>an army can have multiple battle plans at once, a division can only ever belong to one battle plan</strong>. <br>
            This means that if you have a battle plan containing all divisions in an army, then any subsequent battle plans must then contain no divisions. <br>
            Empty battle plans will be <strong>dashed</strong> and indicate that they have no divisions assigned.
        </p>

        <p>
            Being able to draw multiple battle plans is actually quite useful as players can freely <strong>reassign divisions to other battle plans</strong>. <br>
            To do so, either use the <strong>division assignment mode button and left click</strong> the order you wish to reassign them to or use <strong>control left click</strong>. 
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/62 division assignment.png" alt="26 divisions are being reassigned to an empty front line. The division reassignment button and message are highlighted.">
            <figcaption>A common mistake when reassigning divisions is not selecting the correct divisions, so beware!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Sometimes you also just want some divisions to micro freely. To achieve this, divisions can be <strong>unassigned</strong> from battle plans by selecting them and using the 
            <strong>division unassignment button</strong> or <strong>pressing control H</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/63 division unassignment.png" alt="The battle plan bar. The division unassignment button is highlighted.">
            <figcaption>Unassigned divisions will have a red exclamation mark on their division symbol!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Back to our original frontline. There's not much use having two frontlines on the exact same border, so let's <strong>delete</strong> one of them. Deleting battle plans 
            can be done by either <strong>selecting the delete button</strong> or <strong>pressing the delete key</strong>, and then <strong>left clicking</strong> the battle plan. <br>
            All battle plans of an army can be deleted by <strong>right clicking the delete button</strong> (with a confirmation).
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/64 battle plan deletion.png" alt="The battle plan bar. The battle plan deletion button is highlighted.">
        </figure>

        <p>
            To wrap up battle plan editing, sometimes you want to <strong>modify an existing battle plan</strong> instead of having to delete and redraw it. <br>
            By either clicking the <strong>edit mode button</strong> or <strong>holding down left alt</strong>, a player can modify existing battle plans by 
            <strong>moving the endpoints</strong> elsewhere. <br>
            To move an endpoint, <strong>right click and drag</strong> the <strong>anchor</strong>. Where the mouse travels through 
            will determine which provinces the new line should or should not cover (this only applies to offensive and fallback lines, not frontlines).
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/65 editing battle plan.png" alt="A frontline is being edited. The battle plan bar's edit mode button and the two anchors of the frontline are highlighted.">
            <figcaption>Two or more battle plans with the same endpoint will fight for the anchor. Typically, the newer battle plan will be the only selectable anchor until it is moved.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Back to battle plans, let's now cover the <strong>offensive line</strong>. <br>
            The offensive line is an <strong>extension</strong> of a frontline that tells where divisions should advance to. An offensive line <strong>cannot be drawn without a frontline</strong> 
            and <strong>cannot be drawn inside friendly territory</strong>. <br>
            To draw an offensive line, <strong>select the offensive line button</strong> and <strong>right click and drag</strong> a line <strong>into enemy territory</strong> 
            (starting at where you want the starting endpoint of the line to be) where you <strong>want your divisions to end up</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/66 drawing offensive line.png" alt="An offensive line being drawn into Mexico.">
            <figcaption>An offensive line can be as long or short as you want.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Note that with an offensive plan, your army will now display an <strong>execution arrow</strong>. Clicking that arrow will <strong>begin the plan</strong> while 
            clicking the <strong>red stop button</strong> will <strong>pause execution</strong>. <br>
            Note that an offensive plan cannot be executed during peacetime or if your target is not at war with you.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/67 plan execution.png" alt="An army with an offensive plan that can be executed.">
            <figcaption>The game will attempt to calculate how good your plan is, but it's not too accurate. Once you get experienced enough, you can gauge a plan yourself!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Lastly, we'll talk about <strong>fallback lines</strong>. <br>
            Unlike the above two battle plan, a fallback line is a <strong>defensive</strong> battle plan that <strong>cannot be drawn outside of friendly territory</strong>. <br>
            To draw a fallback line, <strong>select the fallback line button</strong> or <strong>press C</strong> and <strong>right click and drag</strong> a line within your 
            territory. You can correct mistakes while drawing by <strong>doubling back</strong> on provinces, which will deselect them from the line (given that the line can still 
            be a solid line after the province's removal).
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/68 drawing fallback line.png" alt="A fallback line being drawn.">
            <figcaption>A fallback line can be any shape or length you want!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            And that's all the battle plans we'll be talking about! Take a moment to digest everything you've learnt and maybe take a break! In due time, you'll learn to recognize
            each battle plan and when to use them. <br>
            If you're playing along, I recommend making a frontline for each hostile neighbour and one entire army per those frontline (unless the frontline is small). If you're 
            playing the <em>German Reich</em>, I recommend frontlines on <em>France</em>, <em>Czechoslovakia</em>, <em>Poland</em>, and the <em>Netherlands</em>, while if you're 
            playing <em>Italy</em>, I recommend frontlines on <em>Ethiopia</em>, <em>France</em>, and <em>Yugoslavia</em>, as well as half an army on each side of your north African 
            holdings.

        <h4 id="1.2.4_-_War_Diplomacy">1.2.4 - War Diplomacy</h4>

        <p>
            Of course, all the guns and plans in the world is of no use if you never go to war! <br>
            Unlike other grand strategy games such as <b>Civilization</b>, there is no concept of surprise wars. War can only be declared if <strong>one has a wargoal</strong>
            (commonly referred to in other games as a <strong>Casus Belli</strong>). <br>
            A wargoal is typically obtained in two ways, either from <strong>events or national focuses</strong> or from <strong>justifications</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, <strong>right clicking on any country</strong> (either with nothing selected or a province/state selected) will open the <strong>diplomatic screen</strong>
            with that country (you can also open it for yourself, which can allow you to see some basic information about yourself). <br>
            Here, you can perform a multitude of different political actions, but we'll only be focusing on the top two, <strong>declare war</strong> and <strong>justify war goal</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/70 war diplomacy.png" alt="The diplomatic menu with the Dominion of Canada.">
            <figcaption>We'll discuss what the rest of these actions do in chapter 2!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            First, you can declare war on another country at any time <strong>as long as you have a wargoal against them</strong>. If you have a wargoal, an alert icon will appear 
            that, when <strong>moused over</strong>, will display all your current wargoals, including their type and if or when they will expire.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/71 available wargoal alert.png" alt="Two topple governments wargoals available for the USA against the UK and Japan.">
            <figcaption>Focuses can grant you all kinds of cool wargoals for free!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            In the absence of a wargoal, and depending on your country's <strong>ideologoical alignment</strong>, you may be able to <strong>manually justify</strong> a wargoal. <br>
            This will cost <strong>political power</strong> and take <strong>a number of days</strong> before the justification completes. The wargoal you get will also have 
            an expiration date, resulting in a penalty if you don't declare the war.

        <p>
            Now for the final major topic of this section, let's talk about the basics of combat. <br>
            We've already covered how to issue an attack order back in the section on microing and how to set up offensive plans in the section on armies. Now, we'll talk a bit 
            about how battles actually work.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, let's focus back on one division. This time, we'll be talking about some of the other visible stats and bars. <br>
            The <strong>green bar</strong> shows the division's <strong>organization</strong>. Organization is reduced by a division's actions, such as <strong>moving, attacking, or defending</strong>. 
            It is <strong>passively regained over time</strong> when a division is not performing an action. <br>
            The <strong>orange bar</strong> shows the division's <strong>strength</strong>. Strength represents the health of the unit, which can be reduced by <strong>losses in combat</strong>.
            A unit with lower strength <strong>fights at lower effectiveness</strong> and a division is <strong>destroyed</strong> if its strength reaches zero. Units are 
            <strong>automatically reinforced over time</strong> if reinforcements and equipment are <strong>available</strong>. <br>
            The <strong>yellow bar and emblem</strong> shows a unit's <strong>experience</strong>. It is gained through <strong>combat</strong> and <strong>training</strong> and 
            lost through <strong>losses</strong>. Units with higher experience <strong>fights more effectively</strong>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            If a division from one side of a war attempts to move into a province occupied by a division from the other side, a <strong>battle begins</strong>. <br>
            Each battle is indicated by a <strong>battle pin</strong> which contains a <strong>colour</strong> (green, yellow, or red) and a <strong>number</strong> (0 to 100). <br>
            The closer the <strong>number is to 0 or 100</strong>, the closer the <strong>battle is to ending</strong>, in favour of <strong>their side or your side respectively</strong>. <br>
            A <strong>green battle</strong> indicates the battle is going <strong>well</strong> for you. A <strong>red one</strong> indicates the battle is going <strong>poorly</strong>. 
            A <strong>yellow battle</strong> is indeterminate. <br>
            <strong>Mousing over</strong> a battle pin shows the estimate of when the battle will end. <strong>Clicking</strong> a battle pin shows the details about the battle 
            (we'll explain this pop up in more detail in chapter 2).
        </p>

            <figcaption>Green = good, red = bad! High number = good, low number = bad!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            A battle ends if one side's <strong>units in combat</strong> runs out of <strong>org</strong>. <br>
            If the <strong>defenders win the battle</strong>, the attackers will end their attack. <br>
            If the <strong>attackers win the battle</strong>, the defenders will be <strong>dislodged</strong> and forced to <strong>retreat to a nearby province</strong>. <br>
            <strong>If a defending unit is forced to retreat, but has no friendly provinces to retreat to, the unit is destroyed.</strong> 
            The tactic of surrounding a unit in order to faciliate this is known as performing an <strong>encirclement</strong>. <br>
            Units that are encircled <strong>cannot recieve supply and reinforcements</strong>.

            And with that, that's everything I think a beginner should know before jumping into the deep end! With this knowledge, other guides as well as the Hearts of Iron IV 
            official wiki should be much more accessible, as is the upcoming second chapter of this guide! If you were following along in game, you are free to unpause and 
            try to get as far as you can. No shame in failure, especially in a game like this! <br>
            Feel free to try exploring the game yourself now, even if you need to turn down the difficulty of the game. <strong>Good luck on your progression!!</strong>
